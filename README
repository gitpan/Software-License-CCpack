NAME
    Software::License::CCpack - Software::License pack for Creative Commons'
    licenses

VERSION
    version 1.0

SYNOPSIS
            my $license = Software::License::CC_BY_3_0->new({
                    holder => 'Brendan Byrd',
            });

            say $license->fulltext;

DESCRIPTION
    This "license pack" contains all of the licenses from Creative Commons,
    except for CC0, which is already included in Software::License.

    Note that I don't recommend using these licenses for your own CPAN
    modules. (Most of the licenses aren't even compatible with CPAN.)
    However, S:L modules are useful for more than mere CPAN::Meta::license
    declaration, so these modules exist for those other purposes.
